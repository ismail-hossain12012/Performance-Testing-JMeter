Dear,
Ehsanul Alam Sabbir Sir,

I've completed a performance test on frequently used API for test App.
Test executed for the below-mentioned scenario in server 000.000.000.00.

100 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is - 08 And Total Concurrent API requested: 600. 

150 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is - 12 And Total Concurrent API requested: 900.

200 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is - 17 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1200.

300 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is - 26 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1800.


While executing 300 concurrent requests, found 44 requests got connection timeout and the error rate is 0.11%

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 1600 API calls with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report in the attachment and let me know if you have any further queries.
